This report compares key metrics from Adobe Analytics to the comparable metrics from Google Analytics for a single site from **`r start_date` to `r end_date`**. For each metric, a boxplot shows the median, quartiles, and outliers of the _daily difference_ between Adobe Analytics and Google Analytics for the metric. A line chart shows the _actual values reported_ for the metric from both platforms. And, another line chart shows the _% difference_ between the results for each day (with the Adobe Analytics value as the basis).

This report was built using R, and the code used to built it is [available here on Github](https://github.com/gilliganondata/aa-ga-compare). It can readily be customized to accommodate additional metrics as needed.

<!-- RMarkdown doesn't readily support loops for output like charts, 
so you need to manually create a section for each metric being included.
That's what's going on from here on out. You just need to tweak the 
value being passed into the summary_results function, and you need
to adjust the r code chunk names so that there aren't any duplicates. -->
