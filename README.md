# aa-ga-compare
This RMarkdown script builds a report that compares key metrics from Adobe Analytics to the comparable metrics from Google Analytics for a single site. For each metric, a boxplot shows the median, quartiles, and outliers of the daily difference between Adobe Analytics and Google Analytics for the metric. A line chart shows the actual values reported for the metric from both platform. And, another line chart shows the % difference between the results for each day (with the Adobe Analytics value as the basis).
